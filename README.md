My website Name is Residential-Era.
Live site: https://residential-era.web.app

Features of my website:
- This repository contains a residential estate website built with React, featuring authentication functionality using Firebase. Users can register and log in using email/password, Google, or GitHub authentication methods. Passwords can be shown or hidden for enhanced security.

- The website utilizes React Router for navigation, including private routes that are accessible only to logged-in users.

- When user is logged in , User information is dynamically displayed in the navbar upon successful authentication. Additionally, a custom 404 page is implemented to handle route not found errors.

- Logged-in users have access to a protected route where they can update their username and photo URL. This feature enhances user engagement by allowing them to personalize their profile information.

- The website integrates 3 npm packages (AOSPackage, React-leaflet, Swiper slider ) to enhance user experience. These include AOSPackage for smooth animations, React-leaflet for interactive maps, and Swiper slider for dynamic image carousels. These features contribute to the website's modern and engaging design.
